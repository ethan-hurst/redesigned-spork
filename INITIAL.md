## FEATURE:

a toolset that will prompt the user for what Dynamics and Power Platform tools they're using which will generate an architectural reference for their stack.

## EXAMPLES:

We have an example of a simple architectural diagram.

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
